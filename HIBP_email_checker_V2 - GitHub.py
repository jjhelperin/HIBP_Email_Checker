    Reads a CSV file_path and a start_row for which row to start processing

        emails to be checked.
    :param content: Either a list of headers if new CSV is 
        wanted as a result, otherwise, provide a file path 
        that will be used to append the results to. If a file path
        is provided, 'content' is then to be used in conjuction with 'append'.
        If 'content' is a file path and 'append' is True, the results of the
        program will be appended to the file provided by the file path. If
        append is False, a new CSV will be created and all of that file's 
        headers will be used as the fields to be found. If the latter is the
        case, be sure that the headers of the content file have the same exact
        headers as wherever the data associated with the email is coming from.
        Default is None, i.e. create a new CSV with all headers and data 
        associated with the emails within 'file_path_with_emails'.
    :param append: If 'append' is True, the program will append the results to 
        the file provided by content. If 'append' is False, the program will 
        create a new CSV with the file name specified by the global variable
        'save_to_file_path', but with the same headers as the file specified
        by content.
    :param start_row: The row to start processing data on in 
        email_file_path.
    :param stop_row: The row, inclusive, in the CSV file to stop processing data on.
    :param lookup_file_path: If the data associated with the emails
        exist in another file, pass the file path here. Should be used if for
        example, 'file_path_with_emails' only has a specific list of emails to 
        check, but the data associated with the emails exists within a
