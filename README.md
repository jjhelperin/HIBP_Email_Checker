# HIBP_Email_Checker
Queries HaveIBeenPwned.com's API against emails

To the readers: This project was given to me by the CTIO of the California Association of Realtors (CAR) during my internship at CAR in the summer of 2019. The task was to check query the API with over 240,000 CAR associated emails and check to see if each emails have been compromised by a data breach. The first function is a bit clunky because I had to deal with some data issues (like having the the emails in a lookup table separately), but the code is documented and commented so it hopefully makes sense. There were a lot of things I could have done better retrospectively, but hey, hindsight is 20-20.
